            Artificial Intelligence: The game will incorporate AI-controlled characters and they contribute to the overall story progression and provide additional gameplay challenges.
            Overall, Robin Hood: New Generation offers a dynamic and thrilling platform game experience, combining elements of stealth and strategy.
