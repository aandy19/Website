            <p style="color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center;">Welcome to our team's story! 
              We are a dynamic group of four individuals brought together by a common goal, to create an exceptional project. 
                Drawing inspiration from the beloved Subway Surfers game, we embarked on a journey fueled by our collective imagination. 
                As we poured our creativity into every aspect of the game, we not only crafted a captivating adventure but also honed our programming skills along the way. 
                The process of developing this game has been a transformative experience, opening the doors to the vast world of Unity and expanding our understanding of game development. 
                With dedication, perseverance, and a shared passion for innovation, we have crafted an immersive gaming experience that we are thrilled to share with you. 
                Join us as we continue to push boundaries, explore new horizons, and bring our imaginative visions to life.</p>
