    <p style="color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center">Robin will face various obstacles that will slow him down during his harvest. 
        Once the single-player mode is finished, the group plans to offer a multiplayer experience centered on many of our levels. 
        This entails incorporating a wide range of gameplay options, such as new enemies and a constantly changing environment. 
        All of these tasks, as well as the main artistic tasks for creating a cartoonish style environment supported by a musical environment, are detailed in this book of specifications. 
        Each task is assigned to a group member who has a backup. Everyone will learn how to code in order to create a Unity game. 
        All team members will have the opportunity to learn about game design, creating a mu- sical environment, and creating 2D assets. 
        Finally, this book of specification contains a detailed description, approach, and schedule for all of these tasks, as well as the deadlines for each of the presentations.</p>
